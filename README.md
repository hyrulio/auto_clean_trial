# auto_clean_trial
First project obviously, just follow what it says when you go to run it i made it pretty easy to use, just remember to put the spaces between the numbers for options, mainly use Gemini to code but i type it all myself and always try to code parts myself, this one had roughly 1/8th made without a guide with 183 lines in it. I learn best with trial-by-fire and tend to do harder projects (harder for me at least) before hopping into smaller ones, so if you ever get surprised at how they get uploaded you were warned but also it might be that i just didnt want to upload it at the time due to whatever reason (e.g, not ready yet since I debug the best i can before releasing, using it for another project i want to be paired with it, just dont actually know people want it, being lazy, etc) I just tried it recently and found the browser search didn't actually work quite right so likely going to try and fix it unless it gets fixed for me
