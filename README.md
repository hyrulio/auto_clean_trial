# auto_clean_trial
First project obviously, just follow what it says when you go to run it i made it pretty easy to use, just remember to put the spaces between the numbers for options, mainly use Gemini to code but i type it all myself and always try to code parts myself, this one had roughly 1/8th made without a guide with 183 lines in it
